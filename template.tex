The abstract should introduce that human-robot interaction and long-term autonomy have an area of overlap of growing importance, as robots both become more self-sufficient and push deeper into human environments like workplaces and public spaces. It should preview that we will look for relevant work from both sides, particularly any that addresses issues specific to this intersection, without jumping to any of our conclusions about the problem as a whole.

\chapter{Introduction}

The introduction will expand on the abstract by going into more detail about the definitions of human-robot interaction and autonomy/LTA, as well as discussing some of the specific examples of robots and situations where their intersection is relevant (autonomous taxis, warehouse robots, domestic robots, getting onto public transit or even through a door). It should be short, saving the heavy lifting for the next section and may involve no or few references of its own, except possibly to provide some key definitions or a few touchstone authors/papers to help the reader get their bearing.

\section{Background}

After the intro's high-level overview, this section of the Introduction goes into more detail scoping and justifying why we think the intersection area of HRI and LTA is a cohesive topic in the literature presenting unique and interesting problems.

-The STRANDS project (likely to reappear later in LTA)
-Possibly some supporting references on robots entering the workplace, like Amazon's warehouses, autonomous 
-Whoever originally said robots were for "dull, dirty or dangerous" work

\section{Navigation}

This is not the only section in which robot navigation is discussed, but should be the one explaining the core concept apart from when humans are involved. The references here should explain how autonomous navigation is a fundamental, perhaps even defining part of being an autonomous robot, and has therefore been a central focus of robotics research for decades. Papers that focus on navigation by lone robots or by fully-controlled multi-robot systems are appropriate, as are ones about navigation algorithms, ideally examples that do not consider other robots or humans or else treat them as dynamic obstacles instead of interacting agents.

The terminal references of this section will be a discussion of Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles and some of the research related to that, as well as crowd modelling from the likes of Dinesh Manocha. These provide a natural segue to the start of the next chapter by highlighting work that addresses the reciprocal and cooperative elements of navigation.

\chapter{Human-Robot Interaction}

This chapter will explore human-robot interaction starting from the lead given at the end of the last chapter on navigation. The goal is not to survey all of human-robot interaction but to follow a thread outward from navigation toward what features make for a more successful social human interaction.

To bridge from one chapter to the other, I'll include references for navigation involving biological inspiration (ants, herding, flocking, aggression, all sounds pretty familiar), many of which may use biology as a guide but do not actually use the behaviour to interact with the original species. These references should set up the idea that human-inspired does not necessarily equal human-compliant.

\section{Human-Compliant Navigation}

Compliance literature seems relatively recent and deals in proxemics This is also an opportunity to discuss the machine-learning angle of many of these systems, which are trained on either simulation or real-world data. This will help us later create a juxtaposition between continuous-space, implicit, learned social interactions and discrete, explicit, designed social behaviours.

Robot Navigation in Dense Human Crowds: the Case for Cooperation

Friendly Patrolling: A Model of Natural Encounters	A study on how to make robot behaviour approacheable and inviting, useful in the workplace	2011




\section{Social HRI}

This section widens the scope of our HRI interest beyond navigation to any paper where the robot is engaged in a social interaction with a human. This can still be a wide area, so apart from some major papers and a survey or two, papers that focus on explicit one-on-one interactions are to be favored. The section should hopefully suggest that human acceptance is an important factor to successful social interactions, and raise questions about what characteristics promote cooperation from users.

Social Robots for Long-Term Interaction: A Survey Basically a mandatory survey to reference the breadth of the research area the depth report covers (at least, from 2013) Note: Two more similarly named HRI surveys, but from 2003 and 2007, so pretty out of date

OPTIMo: Online Probabilistic Trust Inference Model for Asymmetric Human-Robot Collaborations	An ongoing trust model. Personalizes to different users, Bayesian techniques employed. "Near-real-time"?

((Social aspects of power/recharge))

Spotting social interaction by using the robot energy consumption

Exploring socially intelligent recharge behaviour for human-robot interaction	Since recharging is something robots are going to have to do, studying how to manage people's social reaction to it is useful.

\section{Human Factors}

This section widens the discussion again to human factor research on robot acceptance and perception by humans, looking at issues like trust, novelty, anthropomorphism, cultural differences and anything else that might explain why people may or may not choose to cooperate with a robot.



-The study about the robot guiding a crowd to a fire escape when a seemingly more direct route is available.
-Anqi Xu's work on trust (particularly recognizing trust being lost and trying to signal that they've learned their lesson and would like trust back)

Towards Industrial Robots with Human-like Moral Responsibilities	Proposing moral safeguards in the workplace that go beyond safety procedures. Concept of a robot that can be responsible is relevant to autonomy.	

\subsection{Asserting, Disagreeing and Refusing}

Socially-Driven Collective Path-Planning for Robot Missions	Concept of fairness used to decide which waypoints to visit when multiple humans have each designated stops but there's too many

When the robot criticizes you…: Self-serving bias in human-robot interaction	Another reminder that if you don't respect the robot's autonomy you won't respect negative feedback	

Evidence that Robots Trigger a Cheating Detector in Humans	They really narrow down on cheating to win (as opposed to other cheating or just the motion involved in cheating) makes an agent seem more autonomous.	

Eyewitnesses are misled by human but not robot interviewers	Large number of respondents were shown a video then questioned by either a human or a robot who tried to mislead them about it. Robot did worse.	

Decision-Making Authority, Team Efficiency and Human Worker Satisfaction in Mixed Human-Robot Teams	Interesting work where humans are willing to give up scheduling autonomy if robot does it more efficiently	2014

Sorry Dave, I'm Afraid I Can't Do That: Explaining Unachievable Robot Tasks Using Natural Language	Example of robots having to disagree/decline user instructions as impossible using natural language	2013

Critic, compatriot or chump? Response to robot blame attribution	Not a surprising result, NOBODY likes getting blamed, but notable since autonomy means being able to stand up to yourself in human interactions

How a robot should give advice	Advice given as friendly suggestion more effective than given as orders. Case for robotic politeness, courtesy

The effects of interruptions on task performance, annoyance, and anxiety in the user interface

Exploring Interruption in HRI using Wizard of Oz	Not sure of significance of work, but topic of exploring when to interrupt humans as a robot is relevant.	

Designing interruptive behaviours of a public environmental monitoring robot	Interesting
 case, where the robot needs to be assertive in a way that will get humans to listen to its instructions.	

\subsection{Influence of Perception}

Robots that express emotion elicit better human teaching	Useful to prove the value of social interaction and cultivating emotional bonds with humans	

Effects of speech on perceived capability	Just a little study that shows robots that are conversational and responsive seem more capable than ones that don't communicate. Even when the communication is irrelevant, just being engaged increases people's perception of the robot.	

Beyond Dirty, Dangerous and Dull: What Everyday People Think Robots Should Do	Good for backing up some assertion about peoples' expectations of robots in the workplace	

"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do!" Switching off a robot	People recognize "Animancy" of robot, might be relevant to philosophical argument about recognition of robot being tied to autonomy

Three's company, or a crowd?: The effects of robot number and behavior on HRI in Japan and the USA	Underlining different reactions to groups vs. individuals and social vs. functional robots	2015

Judging a Bot By Its Cover: An Experiment on Expectation Setting for Personal Robots	A simple reference for how end users don't have the same appreciation for a robot's capabilities as we might, and how important it is to manage expectations	

Which Robot Am I Thinking About?: The Impact of Action and Appearance on People's Evaluations of a Moral Robot	

Do people hold a humanoid robot morally accountable for the harm it causes?	Robot held more accountable than vending machine, less than human. So there are grades of autonomy we recognize (sheepdog example)

Affective Expression in Appearance-constrained Robots	2-pager, non-anthropomorphic robots can still express themselves

The Advisor Robot: Tracing People's Mental Model From a Robot's Physical Attributes	A study with four different robot head and different voices to examine impact on humans, design principles, "uncanny valley" possibly?

\chapter{Conclusion}

The conclusion should go beyond a dry summary of the areas the depth report has covered. While the second chapter worked to justify our interest in the intersection of the following two chapters, it will be necessary to revisit that justification at the end now that the reader has hopefully absorbed enough material to be persuaded of it. By leveraging what human interaction research has learned about the requirements for gaining human, we can again argue that the goals of long-term autonomy in human environments (particularly concerning navigation) will require explicit, intentional design of recognition- and reciprocation-inducing behaviours.

It is also partly the purpose of a depth report to point the way toward the eventual thesis. In this case, the depth report will hopefully have suggested that there is a rich vein to be mined figuring out how to promote recognition, reciprocation, and ultimately acceptance from human users for robots' social agency in order to enable their navigational autonomy as part of achieving Long Term Autonomy.
